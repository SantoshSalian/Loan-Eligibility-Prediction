# Loan-Eligibility-Prediction

The loan approval process is a challenging task for any financial institution. Before giving credit loans to borrowers, the bank decides whether the borrower is bad (defaulter) or good (non-defaulter). This project focuses on developing Machine Learning (ML) models to predict loan eligibility, which is vital in accelerating the decision-making process and determining if an applicant gets a loan or not.

Dream Housing Finance company deals in all home loans. They have a presence across all urban, semi-urban, and rural areas. Customer-first applies for a home loan after that company validates the customer eligibility for a loan.

The company wants to automate the loan eligibility process (real-time) based on customer detail provided while filling the online application form. These details are Gender, Marital Status, Education, Number of Dependents, Income, Loan Amount, Credit History, and others. To automate this process, they have given a problem to identify the customer's segments, those are eligible for loan amount so that they can specifically target these customers.
